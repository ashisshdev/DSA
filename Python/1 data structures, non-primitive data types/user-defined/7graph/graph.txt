A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

Simply, A graph can be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices. 

Graphs are categoarised in majorly two ways
1 Directed grapps
- movement is uni-directional , a one-way street , followers on twitter
2 UnDirected graphs 
- movement is bi-directional, a two-way highway between two cities , friends on facebook 

On the basis of parent-child relationship:  
A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.
Thus we can say that a normal Binary Search Tree is also a graph that is acyclic i.e. it follows a strictly parent-child relationship only.

Another way to classify graphs is weights:
The nodes can carry any value but the edges/lines/arcs that connect those nodes can also have a value called weight. 
For example, two roads connects two cities but one is longer than the other, we can describe it as one road have more weight than onther.
This way graphs can be of two types:
Weighted Graphs - every edge have its weight
Unweighted Graphs - every edge has either 0 or equal wieght as any other edge
