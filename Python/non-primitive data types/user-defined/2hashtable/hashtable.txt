Complexity Analysis
Hash tables have an average time complexity of O (1) in the best-case scenario. The worst-case time complexity is O(n). The worst-case scenario occurs when many values generate the same hash key, and we have to resolve the collision by probing.

Real-world Applications
In the real-world, hash tables are used to store data for

Databases
Associative arrays
Sets
Memory cache
Advantages of hash tables
Here, are pros/benefits of using hash tables:

Hash tables have high performance when looking up data, inserting, and deleting existing values.
The time complexity for hash tables is constant regardless of the number of items in the table.
They perform very well even when working with large datasets.
Disadvantages of hash tables
Here, are cons of using hash tables:

You cannot use a null value as a key.
Collisions cannot be avoided when generating keys using. hash functions. Collisions occur when a key that is already in use is generated.
If the hashing function has many collisions, this can lead to performance decrease.
