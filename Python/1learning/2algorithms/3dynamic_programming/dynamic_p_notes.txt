Dynamic programming is a way to solve problems by breaking it down into a collection of subproblems, solving each of those solve problems just once and storing their solutions in case next time the same subproblem occurs.
The main use of dynamic programming is to solve optimization problems. Here, optimization problems mean that when we are trying to find out the minimum or the maximum solution of a problem. The dynamic programming guarantees to find the optimal solution of a problem if the solution exists.

Concept of Caching ~~ Memorization 
storing stuff ahead of time that will be useful later


Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O()

Drawback of this approach is increased space complexity, as we have to cache results.
