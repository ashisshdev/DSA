# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# list = []
# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

# tuplet = ()
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
    # CRUD once created

# map = {key:value}
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.

# set = {}
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
    # We can add or remove elements after creation but can not update them
