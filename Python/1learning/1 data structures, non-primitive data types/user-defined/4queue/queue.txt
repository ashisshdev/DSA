A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.  It means that the element that is inserted first in the queue will come out first and the element that is inserted last will come out last. It is an ordered list in which insertion of an element is done from one end which is known as the rear end and deletion of an element is done from the other which is known as the front end.

Just like a real life Queue.
