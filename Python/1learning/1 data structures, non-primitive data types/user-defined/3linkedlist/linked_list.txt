A Linked List is a linear data structure that is used to store a collection of data with the help of nodes. A linked list is made up of two items that are data and a reference to the next node.

Linked List can be created or can be implemented using different libraries such as structlinks, llist, collections etc..

In our example we implemented linked list from scrach.

Applcations of Linked Lists:
Linked Lists are used to implement stacks and queues.
Songs in a playlist contain data and next song reference as well as previous song reference. (Doubly Linked Lists)
Can be used to implement Undo and Redo functionalities. 
Web browser timeline, webpages are linked using linked lists.
Switching between two applications is carried out by using “alt+tab” in windows and “cmd+tab” in mac book. It requires the functionality of circular linked list.


Advantages:
Insertion and deletion in linked lists are very efficient.
Linked list can be expanded in constant time.
Uses non-contiguousmemory hence, no memory wastage unlike arrays.

Disadvantages:
More memory required per element as it stores its own value as well as reference/pointer to next value.
To access any element we have to iterate through whole list unline arrays random access is not available because Linked Lists uses dynamic memory allocation.
Same goes for searching in Linked Lists, we have to iterate through each element.
