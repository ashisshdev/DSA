Complexity Analysis
Hash tables have an average time complexity of O (1) in the best-case scenario. The worst-case time complexity is O(n). The worst-case scenario occurs when many values generate the same hash key, and we have to resolve the collision by probing.

Real-world Applications
Databases,Memory cache


Advantages of hash tables
Hash tables have high performance when looking up data, inserting, and deleting existing values.
The time complexity for hash tables is constant regardless of the number of items in the table.
They perform very well even when working with large datasets.
As we discussed earlier that we often have to tradeoff between time and space, hashmaps are used to decrease time complexity at a cost of increased space complexity.

Disadvantages of hash tables
You cannot use a null value as a key.
Collisions cannot be avoided when generating keys using. hash functions. Collisions occur when a key that is already in use is generated.
If the hashing function has many collisions, this can lead to performance decrease.
